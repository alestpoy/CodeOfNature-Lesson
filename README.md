# The Code of Nature: Exploring Fibonacci and Fractals

## Lesson Overview

This cross-curricular lesson explores the fascinating connections between mathematics, biology, and computer science through the study of Fibonacci numbers and fractals. Students will discover how mathematical patterns appear in nature and learn to create visualizations of these patterns using basic programming.

### Goals
- Understand the Fibonacci sequence and its recurrence relation.
- Explore the golden ratio and its connection to Fibonacci numbers.
- Identify examples of Fibonacci numbers and fractals in biological structures.
- Create simple visualizations of Fibonacci spirals and fractal trees using Python.
- Apply pattern recognition skills to analyze natural phenomena.

### Target Audience
- **Grade Level:** High School (Grades 10–12)
- **Courses:** Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, Computer Science Principles, Biology
- **Prerequisites:** Basic algebra, familiarity with sequences, introductory programming (optional)

### Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Mathematics:** Sequences, series, recursion, golden ratio, geometry.
- **Biology:** Phyllotaxis, plant growth patterns, natural selection, fractal branching in trees and lungs.
- **Computer Science:** Algorithm design, recursion, visualization, data representation.
